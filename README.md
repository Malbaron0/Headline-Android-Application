# Headline-Android-Application


My first android application. The application is called headline and its an RSS feed. It has multiple categories such as "sport" or "politics". It then shows you the headlines from [The guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us) and [Daily mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html)
